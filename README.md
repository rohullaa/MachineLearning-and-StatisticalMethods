# Machine learning and statistical methods
My work in STK2100 - Machine Learning and Statistical Methods for Prediction and Classification at UiO.

The course covers topics such as supervised learning (regression and classification) and unsupervised methods like clustering.
The course also deals with issues connected to large amounts of data (’big data’).
